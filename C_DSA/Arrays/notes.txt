Arrays

Declaration of array:
int Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, declaration and initialization
int Arr[5]; // only declaration, it will containt garbage values
int Arr[] = {0} // initialization of all array items to 0
int Arr[3] = {1} // [1|0|0]

Static vs Dynamic Array
Once created, arrays cannot change their lenght! Array size is decided in compile time, memory is allocated during run time.
Array size must be constant value.
If we want to create dynamic size array, we need to use malloc and pointers, HEAP usage.

p = (int *) malloc(5 * sizeof(int)) -> malloc returns void pointer (void *)
